And now I have added the lyrics to Elena Seigman's Pareidolia

I see them staring back at me
They know my name
The faces in the sky are
Looking for something more
My friends have paper smiles and
Laugh at me in all my trials

Their eyes are everywhere
And see everything
What do they
Need me
And I need them
See me
And I see them
Within
The lines they've been
Burned in my mind

It all ends so violently I know
My sweet pareidolia
It all ends so painfully and slow
My pareidolia

My friends have hollow eyes
They're made of shapes and curvy lines

Their eyes are everywhere
And see everything
What do they
Need me
And I need them
See me
And I see them
Within
The lines they've been
Burned in my mind

It all ends so violently I know
My sweet pareidolia
It all ends so painfully and slow
My pareidolia

The loneliness
Is only missed when
I am alone

Oh

Yeah

I might try to find my light tonight
Hide my sight from eyes I try to fight
My nine eyes of light die by the blight
Ride white knight unite my plight tonight

They're inside me
They're inside me

I'm inside out
I'm inside out

They're all around

Within without
Within without

They're inside
I'm outside

They're all around
They're all around

They're inside me
I'm inside out
They're all around
Within without

It all ends so violently I know
My sweet pareidolia
It all ends so painfully and slow
My pareidolia
